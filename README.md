# Noah-React-Portfolio
Challenge 20

## Description
When creating this project, I demonstrated my understanding and ability to use React as a framework to create an applicaiton. I showed that I can initialize a React app and work with its file/folder structure, and I proved that I know how to correctly segment the different building blocks of an application in React. While creating this project, I was also able to realize how fruitful React can be to developers, as it speeds up project creation and assists with organization. This was also my first assignment where I was working with .jsx files, so I learned a lot about interweaving pieces of JavaScript within my HTML code. Additionally, I learned how developers can use Netlify (similarly like Heroku) to house/deploy their applications on the web. Using different React hooks like "useState" was also very interesting to me, and I'm glad creating a Form submission page was part of this assignment.

## Installation
This project is deployed on Netlify and can be viewed [here](https://netlify-noah-react-portfolio.netlify.app/).

## Usage
The usage purpose of this project is to have a deployed application that can serve as my professional portfolio. The portfolio is leverages React to include different pages of what would be helpful for an online portfolio. An about me section is used to explain the purpose of the applicaiton and share information about myself. A projecy page is included to showcase and direct users to some of the projects I've completed. And additionally, a contact me page is included for users to send a message to myself, with a resume page lastly included for anyone to browser my experience and proficient technologies.
